The string type has a large number of methods that can be applied to strings, but those methods can be applied only to strings. Lists have their own associated methods that work only with lists. The number of list methods is quite a bit smaller—only nine. They come in two different categories:\n","\n","* Those that change the list\n","* Those that do `not` change the list\n","\n","It is important that we keep those two categories straight, so we know whether our list is changed as a result of using the method.\n","\n","`Non-modifying methods`\n","\n","* `index(x)` Return the index of the ﬁrst element in the list whose value is equal to x.\n","Python throws an error if there is no such value in the list.\n","* `count(x)` Return the number of times x appears in the list. Returns 0 if x does not appear in the list.\n","\n","`Modigying methods`\n","\n","There are two things to note about these methods. First, the list that calls the method will be modiﬁed as a result of the operation of the method. Second, none of the methods except the pop method returns a value. This fact may seem odd, but taking a closer look may help. In our previous experience, every string method returned a value: a new string object. Remember, though, that strings are immutable. They had to return a value, typically a string, so that the change could be captured. These list methods do not need to return a list object for the change, as the list itself is changed (it is mutable).\n","\n","* `append(x)` Append an element to the end of the list. The length of the list is increased by one. The element is appended exactly, so a collection is added as a single element.\n","* `pop()` Remove the element at the end of the list and return that element. The list is shortened by one element. If an index is speciﬁed, a.pop(an index) removes the element at that position and returns that item.\n","* `extend(C)` Requires a collection C as an argument. The list is extended by adding each individual element of the argument collection C to the end of the list.\n","* `insert(i, x)` Insert an element at a given position. The ﬁrst argument is the index before which to insert in the list. Thus, my list.insert(1, 'a') inserts the 'a' into position 1 of the list, sliding all the rest of the list elements down one (the element at index 1 moves to index 2, the element at index 2 moves to index 3, and so on).\n","* `remove(x)` Remove the ﬁrst element from the list whose value is x. An error results if there is no such item. The length of the list is decreased by one if successful.\n","* `sort()` Sort the elements of the list, in place. If sorting a list of lists, only the ﬁrst element in each list is considered in the comparison operations. Only the order of the list elements is modiﬁed (unless already sorted).1\n","* `reverse()` Reverse the elements of the list, in place. Only the order of the list elements is modiﬁed.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4Ov_2dF3gFUQ","outputId":"3ecde9a9-3fe5-4128-f16b-1265d39a60e0"},"source":["a_list = [1, 12, 5, 8]\n","a_list"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[1, 12, 5, 8]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":35}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"eIKPgxsUgFUR","outputId":"d119a8a6-bb58-4ba4-e371-b275ad996928"},"source":["a_list.append(17) # append to the end\n","a_list"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[1, 12, 5, 8, 17, 17, 17]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":38}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"G2pqNJ6LgFUR","outputId":"33c72289-54b0-4f53-f11f-fc4e0e1a7591"},"source":["a_list.append([40, 50, 60])\n","a_list"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[1, 12, 5, 8, 17, 17, 17, [40, 50, 60]]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":39}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QP0_Ura5gFUS","outputId":"927c6984-697d-4128-d662-9c6ac336daa6"},"source":["another_list = [20, 2]\n","a_list.extend(another_list) # append each element to a list\n","a_list"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[1, 12, 5, 8, 17, 17, 17, [40, 50, 60], 20, 2, 20, 2, 20, 2]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":42}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FbKAMtlTgFUS","outputId":"4fff3a4f-8e22-4ab9-aaae-bc506d1a5c24"},"source":["a_list.insert(3, 'a') # insert `a` at position 3\n","a_list"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[1, 12, 5, 'a', 8, 17, 17, 17, [40, 50, 60], 20, 2, 20, 2, 20, 2]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":43}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ui8S-PjMgFUT","outputId":"341a518b-1b6c-4f6c-949d-81c276023596"},"source":["a_list.remove(8)\n","a_list"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[1, 12, 5, 'a', 17, 17, 17, [40, 50, 60], 20, 2, 20, 2, 20, 2]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":44}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0fsLZ-xNgFUT","outputId":"6a4b70b3-a9ad-4563-ab6d-a16fccd91c46"},"source":["a_list.pop() # pop last element, return it!"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["2"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":45}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wzDLJ0KkgFUU","outputId":"d29dd271-6634-4674-8a87-8d3b7feb3f88"},"source":["a_list.count(5) # count number of occurence"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["1"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":47}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DshK8ipGgFUV","outputId":"30161a1f-7572-43db-def0-64e40ea4dc96"},"source":["a_list.index(17) # return index of argument"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["4"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":48}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sD_9snX2gFUW"},"source":["Ordering: when dealing with functions, methods, or operations that depend on ordering (such as `sort, sorted, reverse, min, max, <, >, ==`) use **only homogeneous elements**, e.g., all numbers or all strings.

So far we have looked at strings, lists, and tuples.\n","What is a data structure? In Section 1.6, we covered the type of an object and what that entailed. We observed that a type described what was stored in an object of a particular type and the operations we can perform on an object of that particular type. More generally, we consider the concept of a data structure. A data structure is related to a data type, in that a data type is the realization (implementation) of a data structure in a program. Thus, a data structure is a more abstract concept, indicating what a programmer would like to be done as opposed to how the programmer actually implements the concept in code (the data type). In particular, a data structure focuses on the organization of data and the operations that can act on the data—often with an emphasis on efﬁciency. For example, a Google search potentially examines the content of the whole Internet. How must one organize this vast amount of data so that searches can be both accurate and fast? Part of the answer is in how the data are organized and manipulated, i.e., what data structures are used. The company founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, became very rich by coming up with a more efﬁcient data structure and algorithm for Internet data search (they named it MapReduce).\n","\n","\n","When we speak of efﬁciency, we could mean one of a few things:\n","\n","* **Efﬁcient with respect to an `algorithm`**. Data structures are tightly linked with the algorithms that work on them. Thus, it might be efﬁcient to perform some operation (sorting, storing, inserting) on a particular organization of the data. However, making one operation efﬁcient might make another operation inefﬁcient on the same data structure.\n","* **Efﬁcient with respect to `space`**. One way to organize the data is to be efﬁcient in\n","memory usage. If the data being stored are very large (say, all the text in the Library of Congress), storage efﬁciency might be very important. Again, how data get stored might well affect what we can efﬁciently do with the data.\n","* **Efﬁcient with respect to `time`**. Another important consideration is time. If our al-\n","gorithm is tasked with controlling ﬂaps on an airplane in ﬂight, then determining proper settings quickly is crucial. Many variables come to play in that decision, and data organization (the data structure) is critical.\n","\n","\n","`Other Example Data Structures`\n","\n","* A `queue` is a sequence of data elements that “stand in a line,” in which the data can only be removed from the front of the line and new elements can only be added to the back of the line (as in the British English: “queue up for the bus”). Elements enter the queue and wait, typically in order, until they come to the front of the queue for removal. Queues are useful for modeling how cars move through intersections or data ﬂows through nodes on the Internet. Associated operations check to see if the queue is empty, add to the back, and remove from the front.\n","* A `dictionary` data structure is one in which we can look up a key (like a word in the dictionary) and access some value (like the deﬁnition of the word). A phone book could be implemented as a dictionary. Operations would include the following: look up a value associated with key, add key-value pairs, remove key-value pairs, etc.\n","* A `set` of unordered elements allows us to access and modify individual elements. Operations would include insertion, removal, union, intersection, etc.\n","* A `matrix` of numbers is a common mathematical data structure that is extensively used in science and engineering. Associated operations would include multiplication, ﬁnd determinant, invert, transpose, etc."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"RW6V4aa_gFU4"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"N6byC94JgFU4"},"source":["**Python Diversion `list comprehension`**\n","\n","Let’s take a diversion into an interesting Python operation: the *comprehension*. A comprehen- sion is a compact way to construct a new collection by performing some simple operations on some or all of the elements of another collection. Its origins lie in mathematical set notation. There is nothing unique about a comprehension. It is simply a shortcut for ex- pressing a way to create a new collection from an old collection. Any comprehension could be implemented using a regular for loop. Shortcuts are nice and have their place. Use them when you are comfortable with them.\n","\n","A way to think about a comprehension is to think of it as a transformation. By using a comprehension, we take a collection and transform its elements into a new collection. In Python there are a number of different kinds of comprehensions depending on the type of the result collection being generated. What they have in common are the following:\n","* They are surrounded by either square brackets or braces, which indicates the type of the comprehension and thus the type of the resulting collection.\n","* They have as their ﬁrst element an expression.
