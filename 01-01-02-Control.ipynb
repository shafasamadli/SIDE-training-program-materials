    "An iterator is an object associated with all the collection types in Python. A collection in Python is a single object that contains multiple elements that are associated with the collection object. For example, a string is such a collection. It is a single object that has a group of individual characters, each associated with the string. In fact, a string is a particular kind of collection, called a sequence. A sequence is a collection where there is an order associated with the elements. A string is a sequence because the order of the characters is important. A set is a collection that is not a sequence, as membership, not order, is important for a set. However, for both a string and a set—in fact, for any Python collection—an iterator allows us to examine each individual element in that collection, one at a time. Such a collection is called an iterable, a collection that can be examined by a for loop. For a sequence, the iterable’s access is ordered, so that when we iterate through a sequence, we iterate through each element in the sequence in order, from ﬁrst to last. The for loop uses the collection’s associated iterator to give us programmatic access to the individual elements of a collection.\n",

The variable an element is assigned a different element during each pass of the for loop. Eventually, an element will have been assigned to each element in the collection. The variable collection is a collection that has an associated iterator that acts as the source of elements. The keyword in precedes the collection.

    "The `else` clause is often used in conjunction with the `break` statement. The `break` statement can be used to *immediately* exit the execution of the current loop and skip past all the remaining parts of the loop suite. It is important to note that “skip past” means to skip the `else` suite (if it exists) as well. Remember, the `else` is only entered if the loop condition becomes `False`. The `break` statement is useful for stopping computation when the “answer” has been found or when continuing the computation is otherwise useless."
