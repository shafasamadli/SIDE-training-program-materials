    "A common concept in modern programming languages design is the object-oriented program- ming paradigm. Object-oriented programming, or OOP for short, is a general approach to programming that grew out of a need to handle the increasing complexity of programming. It is not the only approach, and hopefully you will be exposed to others, but it is common and has a number of advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is really a point of view. That point of view is that a program is a set of objects, where each object can interact with other program objects to accomplish the programmer’s goal. These objects will have two characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each object has some number of `attributes` (e.g., color, make) that are stored within the object.\n",
    "* The object responds to some `methods`, which are also attributes, that are particular for that kind of object (e.g., move forward, print).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is Object-Oriented!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that we have been working with the OOP paradigm all along, because Python is fundamentally an OOP language. We have spoken often of Python objects and their associated methods. When we call a constructor such as `list` or `str` (or their shortcuts `[ ]` and `' '`), we are making a new object. Those objects have attributes. Both a list and string object are collections with multiple parts. Those objects respond to methods. We can sort a list by calling the method `my_list.sort()`, change a string to lowercase with the method `my_str.lower()`. We know how to work with objects; now we are moving on to making our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there is a strong similarity between a type and a class. We have seen many examples of the difference among objects that are of type `str, list, int`, and many others. They store different things (strings store only strings, lists store any object, integers store only non-ﬂoating-point numbers) and respond to different methods, and even the same methods in different ways (the binary operator minus `-` is set difference for a set, subtraction for an integer).\n",

    "The viewpoint we take in this book is that a `class` is a `template` for making a new object and that an object made by a class template is called an `instance` of that class. Using a simple analogy, class and instance have a relationship similar to that between a cookie cutter and a cookie. A cookie cutter is a template for stamping out cookies. Once the template is made, we can stamp out any number (an inﬁnite number, in fact) of cookies, each one formed in the likeness deﬁned by the cutter (template).\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP works similarly. A class is a template for making an instance, and the instance reﬂects the structure provided by the template, the class. The class can “stamp out” any number (in fact, an inﬁnite number) of instances, each in the likeness of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply our new terminology, class and instance, to the programming we have been doing. Any of the built-in data structures are defined as a class: a list is a class, as is a string, set, tuple, or dictionary. These classes can be used to make individual instances using either the constructor (respectively `list, str, set, tuple, dict`) or their shortcuts, where available. The constructor creates a new object, which is an instance of the class. These instances have internal attributes and associated methods that may be applied to those instances."

Class names use what is called the `CapWords` approach. Each word is capitalized, joined together without underscores. After assignment and `def`, the keyword `class` is our third example of making a new association in a namespace. The name that follows the keyword is the name of the class, and that name becomes associated with a class object. After the class name we include, in parentheses, the name of the parent class of our class.\n",

This particular class has what is essentially an empty suite, except Python will not syntactically allow an empty suite. We use the Python keyword `pass` as we have before to indicate that the suite is indeed empty. In this context, the keyword pass is an indication of intent. We, the class designers, did not forget to add content; we intended to have no content.\n",

Even though we provided no attributes to `MyClass`, that class does indeed have a set of attributes, most of which begin and end with double underscore characters `_`. Python reserves a number of special methods and variables that begin with with a pair of underscore characters. These have predeﬁned meaning to Python in its OOP class system.
