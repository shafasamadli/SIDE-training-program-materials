For starters, we will talk about a variable as something that represents a value: an integer, a string, a ﬂoating-point number, and so on.

Thus, a variable is really a way to make it easier to read the program you are writing.\n","\n","How does Python associate the value of the variable with its name? In essence, Python makes a list of names (variables, but other names as well) that are being used right now in the Python interpreter. The interpreter maintains a special structure called a namespace to keep this list of names and their associated values. Each name in that list is associated with a value, and the Python interpreter updates both names and values during the course of its operation.

The left-hand side represents the variable name and the right-hand side represents the value. If the variable does not yet exist, then the variable is created and placed in the namespace otherwise, the variable’s value is updated to the value on the right-hand side.
